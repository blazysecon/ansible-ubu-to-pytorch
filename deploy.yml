# 0. register on the NVIDIA dev site and download the two CUDNN 7.4 or
#    later DEBs. These should go in the downloads/ subdir of this
#    repo. Ensure that the names in vars.yml match your downloads.
# 1. The destination machine should have Ubuntu 18.04 installed. Also,
#    ssh your_user@machine should let you in without
#    password. your_user should be able to sudo.
# 2. edit vars.yml -- change user to your login and sudo user on destination machine
# 3. edit inventory.cfg -- set the destination machine IP number / hostname under [app]
# 4. ansible-playbook -i inventory.cfg deploy.yml
